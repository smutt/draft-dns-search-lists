    <abstract>
      <t>A Domain Name System (DNS) "search list" (hereafter, simply "search
      list") is an ordered list of domain names. When a user enters a
      name, the domain names in the search list are used as suffixes
      to the user-supplied name, one by one, until a domain name with
      the desired associated data is found or the search list is
      exhausted. <xref  target="RFC1123"/></t>

      <t>Processing search lists was weakly standardized in early Requests For
      Comments (RFCs) <xref  target="RFC1123"/>, <xref
      target="RFC1535"/>, <xref target="RFC1536"/> and implemented in most
      operating systems. However, as the Internet has grown, search
      list behavior has diversified. Applications (e.g., web browsers,
      mail clients) and DNS resolvers process search lists
      differently. In addition, some of these behaviors present
      security and privacy issues to end systems, can lead to
      performance problems for the Internet, and can cause collisions
      with names  provisioned under delegated top-level domains.</t>

      <t>In this document, we make three proposals regarding when and
      how to use DNS search lists.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Many organizations create subdomains under their primary domain(s) to
      delegate or distribute management of their namespace, reduce the load on
      their authoritative DNS servers, and more easily distinguish a host's
      organizational and/or geographical affiliations. It then often
      becomes common within these organizations to only use the
      subdomain internally as an abbreviated form of reference.</t>

      <t>As a convenience to users, many operating systems implement search
      list processing, a feature that allows a user to enter a partial name in
      an application, with the operating system expanding the name through
      entries in a search list.</t>

      <t>For example, if a user has a search list of
      "corp.example.com;berlin.example.com;example.com" and she types "system"
      into her browser's address box, the operating system would try
      "system.corp.example.com", "system.berlin.example.com",
      "system.example.com", and perhaps "system." in some order.</t>

      <t>While this may be convenient for users who do not wish to
      use a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) it comes with security
      implications that may not be immediately evident to the
      user. The most obvious of which being that the user can not
      know precisely which domain name(s) the operating system will
      query for and in what order. Depending on the configuration of
      the user's computer and network this may result in the user
      being tricked into visiting a site they did not intend, and
      consequently place them at risk of being phished or otherwise
      compromised. For more discussion on the security implications of
      search list processing see <xref target="SAC064"/>. </t>
      
      <t>Search list processing, including order of operations for search list
      processing, was loosely specified in <xref target="RFC1123"/>
      (specifically, section 6.1.4.3 (2)), <xref target="RFC1535"/>,
      and <xref target="RFC1536"/> and has been implemented in most
      operating systems. Processing of search lists received via DHCP
      and IPv6 Router Advertisements (RA) is standardized in <xref
      target="RFC3397"/>, <xref target="RFC3646"/> and <xref
      target="RFC6106"/>. </t>
      
      <t>As the Internet has grown, search list behavior has
      diversified. Applications (e.g., web browser and mail clients)
      and DNS resolvers process search list suffixes differently. Some
      of these behaviors also present security and privacy issues to
      end systems <xref target="SAC064"/> <xref target="RFC3397"/>,
      and performance problems both for the end system and the
      Internet.</t>

        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
        "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
        "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described
        in <xref  target="RFC2119"/>.</t>

    <section title="Search List Best Practices">
	    <section title="Implicit search lists">
		    <t>An implicit search list is a search list automatically derived
        from some part of a host's Fully Qualified Domain Name
        (FQDN). Implicit search lists are not manually configured by users
        or network administrators. The most common implicit search list is
        a list with a single entry composed only of the host's immediate
        parent domain. For example, a host with FQDN a.example.org might
        have an implicit search list of example.org.</t> 
        
		    <t>If search lists are required, operators MUST configure the
        search list manually, and MUST NOT use implicit search lists. If
        no search list is manually configured and an unqualified
        single-label domain name (i.e., dotless domain) 
        is to be queried, the query MUST NOT be generated.</t>
        
		    <t>This behavior updates the advice given in <xref
        target="RFC1536"/> section 6.</t>
	    </section>
      
	    <section title="Overriding manually configured search lists">
		    <t>A search list configured manually on a host by an operator
        SHOULD NOT be overridden by DHCP or IPv6 Router Advertisements
        (RAs). A host MAY use a search list learned via DHCP or IPv6 RAs
        only if it has no manually configured search list.</t>
        
	      <t>For further discussion on how hosts should process DNS
        search lists learned via DHCP or IPv6 RAs see <xref
        target="RFC6106"/> section 5.3.1.</t>
	    </section>
      
	    <section title="Querying unqualified single-label domain names">
		    <t>Unqualified single label domain names MUST NOT be queried
        directly.  When a user enters a single label name into an
        application, that name MUST be subject to search list processing if
        a search list is specified, and MUST NOT be queried in the DNS
        in its original single-label form.</t>
	    </section>
      
	    <section title="Querying multi-label domain names">
		    <t>Multi-label domain names MAY be subject to search list
        processing if a search list is specified. Multi-label domain
        names MUST NOT be subject to search list processing if their
        right most character is a dot(".").</t>
	    </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Negative Consequences For the Change">
      <t>There are operators that today rely on a combination of both
      implicit search lists, and the automatic propagation of search lists to
      clients via DHCP or IPv6 RA. The proposed changes would require
      operators to update their procedures.</t>

      <t>Changing search list behavior of unqualified multi-label
      domain names MAY potentially reduce the utility of these names.</t>

      <t>Not all applications currently in use treat these categories
      of domain names in the same way. Incompatibilities and operational
      problems, specifically in BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) environments,
      already exist.</t>
