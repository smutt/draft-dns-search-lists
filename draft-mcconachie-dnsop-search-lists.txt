                 DNS Search Lists Considered Dangerous
                    draft-mcconachie-search-list-00

Abstract

   A Domain Name System (DNS) "search list" (hereafter, simply "search
   list") is an ordered list of domain names.  When a user enters a
   name, the domain names in the search list are used as suffixes to the
   user-supplied name, one by one, until a domain name with the desired
   associated data is found or the search list is exhausted.[Ed note:
   This definintion is lifted from RFC 1123.]

   Processing search lists was weakly standardized in early Requests For
   Comments (RFCs)[Ed note: need refs here] and implemented in most
   operating systems.  However, as the Internet has grown, search list
   behavior has diversified.  Applications (e.g., web browsers, mail
   clients) and DNS resolvers process search lists differently.  In
   addition, some of these behaviors present security and privacy issues
   to end systems, can lead to performance problems for the Internet,
   and can cause collisions with names provisioned under delegated top-
   level domains.

   In this document, we make three proposals regarding when and how to
   use DNS search lists.

1.  Introduction

   Many organizations create subdomains under their primary domain(s) to
   delegate or distribute management of their namespace, reduce the load
   on their authoritative DNS servers, and more easily distinguish a
   host's organizational and/or geographical affiliations.  It then
   often becomes common within these organizations to only use the
   subdomain internally as an abbreviated form of reference.

Internet-Draft    DNS Search Lists Considered Dangerous    November 2018


   As a convenience to users, many operating systems implement search
   list processing, a feature that allows a user to enter a partial name
   in an application, with the operating system expanding the name
   through entries in a search list.

   For example, if a user has a search list of
   "corp.example.com;berlin.example.com;example.com" and she types
   "system" into her browser's address box, the operating system would
   try "system.corp.example.com", "system.berlin.example.com",
   "system.example.com", and perhaps "system." in some order.

   While this may be convenient for users who do not wish to use a Fully
   Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) it comes with security implications that
   may not be immediately evident to the user.  The most obvious of
   which being that the user can not know precisely which domain name(s)
   the operating system will query for and in what order.  Depending on
   the configuration of the user's computer and network this may result
   in the user being tricked into visiting a site they did not intend,
   and consequently place them at risk of being phished or otherwise
   compromised.  For more discussion on the security implications of
   search list processing see [SAC064].

   Search list processing, including order of operations for search list
   processing, was loosely specified in [RFC1123] (specifically, section
   6.1.4.3 (2)), [RFC1535], and [RFC1536] and has been implemented in
   most operating systems.  Processing of search lists received via DHCP
   and IPv6 Router Advertisements (RA) is standardized in [RFC3397] and
   [RFC6106].

   As the Internet has grown, search list behavior has diversified.
   Applications (e.g., web browser and mail clients) and DNS resolvers
   process search list suffixes differently.  Some of these behaviors
   also present security and privacy issues to end systems [SAC064]
   [RFC3397], and performance problems both for the end system and the
   Internet.

1.1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft    DNS Search Lists Considered Dangerous    November 2018


2.1.  Implicit search lists

   An implicit search list is a search list automatically derived from
   some part of a host's Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN).  Implicit
   search lists are not manually configured by users or network
   administrators.  The most common implicit search list is a list with
   a single entry composed only of the host's immediate parent domain.
   For example, a host with FQDN a.example.org might have an implicit
   search list of example.org.

   If search lists are required, operators MUST configure the search
   list manually, and MUST NOT use implicit search lists.  If no search
   list is manually configured and an unqualified single-label domain
   name (i.e., dotless domain) is to be queried, the query MUST NOT be
   generated.

   This behavior updates the advice given in [RFC1536] section 6.

2.2.  Overriding manually configured search lists

   A search list configured manually on a host by an operator SHOULD NOT
   be overridden by DHCP or IPv6 Router Advertisements (RAs).  A host
   MAY use a search list learned via DHCP or IPv6 RAs only if it has no
   manually configured search list.

   For further discussion on how hosts should process DNS search lists
   learned via DHCP or IPv6 RAs see [RFC6106] section 5.3.1.

2.3.  Querying unqualified single-label domain names

   Unqualified single label domain names MUST NOT be queried directly.
   When a user enters a single label name into an application, that name
   may be subject to search list processing if a search list is
   specified, but must never be queried in the DNS in its original
   single-label form.

3.  Negative Consequences For the Change

   There are operators that today rely on a combination of both implicit
   search lists, and the automatic propagation of search lists to
   clients via DHCP or IPv6 RA.  The proposed changes would require
   operators to update their procedures.

   Changing search list behavior of unqualified multi-label domain names
   MAY potentially reduce the utility of these names.

   Not all applications currently in use treat these categories of
   domain names in the same way.  Incompatibilities and operational
